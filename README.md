# p-ollution: Air Pollution and Public Health Outcomes

Project Goals:

 - Create website outlining the relationship between air pollution and long term health outcomes (ex: chronic illness diagnoses, impact on lifespan, etc).
 - Identify “hotspots” in the target region where public health is seriously impacted by air pollution. Explore plausible explanations (ex: industrial plants, increase in construction) and utilize neural networks to make forecasts
 - Make all data insights and the website itself accessible to people with various disabilities. Incorporate feedback from disabled people in a respectful way.
